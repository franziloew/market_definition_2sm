	abstract = {Many if not most markets with network externalities are two-sided. To succeed, platforms in industries such as software, portals and media, payment systems and the Internet, must “get both sides of the market on board.” Accordingly, platforms devote much attention to their business model, that is, to how they court each side while making money overall. This paper builds a model of platform competition with two-sided markets. It unveils the determinants of price allocation and end-user surplus for different governance structures (profit-maximizing platforms and not-for-profit joint undertakings), and compares the outcomes with those under an integrated monopolist and a Ramsey planner.

	abstract = {We study how vertical integration in a two-sided media market affects investments in premium content. We show that a content provider provides the premium content exclusively to a platform, regardless of what the vertical structure of the industry is. However, a vertically integrated content provider has lower incentives to invest in quality than an independent one. With asymmetric platforms, the platform with a competitive advantage in the advertising market obtains the exclusive content, and the content provider invests even less when it is integrated with it. We determine that the content provider prefers to acquire the platform with a competitive advantage in the advertising market. Vertical integration reduces both consumer and total surplus. Our results suggest that authorities should carefully assess the effects of a merger on the incentives to invest in content quality, incorporating non-price measures in merger analysis. An intervention at the distribution stage that enforces non-exclusive provision reduces quality and may have adverse effects on consumer and total surplus. Advertising caps might also have the effect of reducing quality.},

Technical evaluations of these methods' pros and cons are not necessarily intuitive. Appraisals that are based on case studies are descriptive but need not be universally valid. This paper opens up the black box called econometrics for competition cases. This is done by complementing theoretical arguments with estimation results. These results are obtained for data that is generated by a simulation-model of a collusive industry. Using such data leaves little room for debate about the quality of these methods because estimates of, e.g., overcharges can be compared to their true underlying values. This analysis provides arguments for demonstrating that thoroughly conducted econometric analyses yield better results than simple techniques such as before-and-after comparisons.},

This paper examines the theoretical basis for the legal definitions and assesses whether the general principles need to be adapted when dealing with the telecommunications services industry. The paper finds that the conventional antitrust methodology for market definition can be, to a large extent, readily applied to the telecoms industry but points out some key adjustments that have to be made to this methodology to ensure that the antitrust and regulatory authorities end up defining markets which capture adequately the nature of the competitive interaction in this industry. The definition of markets should be based on a detailed analysis of demand (both complementarities and substitutabilities) and the consideration of all companies which have the assets and capabilities to satisfy these consumer needs. Such an exercise should be done first, and distinguished from the subsequent analysis of the competitive conditions in the markets defined as relevant.},

Building on the seminal work of Rochet and Tirole (2003), a rapidly growing literature has illuminated the economic principles that apply to 2SPs generally. One key result is that 2SPs may find it profit-maximizing to charge prices for one customer group that are below marginal cost or even negative, and such skewed pricing pattern is prevalent, although not universal, in industries that appear to be based on 2SPs. Over the years, courts have also recognized that certain industries, notably payment card systems and newspapers, now understood to be based on 2SPs, are governed by unusual economic relationships. This chapter provides an introduction to the economics of 2SPs and its application to several competition policy issues.},

I estimate three simultaneous equations: consumer demand for usage of a directory, advertiser demand for advertising and a publisher's first-order condition (derived from profit-maximizing behaviour). Estimation shows that advertisers value consumer usage and that consumers value advertising, implying a network effect. I find that internalizing network effects would significantly increase surplus. As an application, I consider whether the market benefits from monopoly (which takes advantage of network effects) or oligopoly (which reduces market power). I find that a more competitive market is preferable.},

The analysis is performed on data for a merger wave in U.S. radio that occurred between 1996 and 2006. The paper makes two main contributions. First, I identify the conflicting incentives of merged firms to exercise market power on both sides of the market (listeners and advertisers in the case of radio). Second, I disaggregate the effects of mergers on consumers into changes in product variety and changes in supplied ad quantity. I find that firms have moderate market power over listeners in all markets, extensive market power over advertisers in small markets and no market power over advertisers in large markets. Counterfactuals reveal that extra product variety created by post-merger repositioning increased listeners' welfare by 1.3\% and decreased advertisers' welfare by about \$160m per-year. However, subsequent changes in supplied ad quantity decreased listener welfare by 0.4\% (for a total impact of +0.9\%) and advertiser welfare by an additional \$140m (for a total impact of -\$300m).},

In addition, editors may own several newspapers and hence a variety of cross-market effects that result from changes in market prices exist. To estimate demand parameters for both sides of the market, a specific structural model is needed that takes into account those effects. We estimate network effects and price elasticities for Belgian newspaper publishers to assess market power and the degree of competition in the market, which experienced a large consolidation wave over the last decades.

	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2336411},
	abstract = {We model a two-sided market with heterogeneous customers and two heterogeneous network effects. In our model, customers on each market side care differently about both the number and the type of customers on the other side. Examples of two-sided markets are online platforms or daily newspapers. In the latter case, for instance, readership demand depends on the amount and the type of advertisements. Also, advertising demand depends on the number of readers and the distribution of readers across demographic groups. There are feedback loops because advertising demand depends on the numbers of readers, which again depends on the amount of advertising, and so on. Due to the difficulty in dealing with such feedback loops when publishers set prices on both sides of the market, most of the literature has avoided models with Bertrand competition on both sides or has resorted to simplifying assumptions such as linear demands or the presence of only one network effect. We address this issue by first presenting intuitive sufficient conditions for demand on each side to be unique given prices on both sides. We then derive sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium in prices. For merger analysis, or any other policy simulation in the context of competition policy, it is important that equilibria exist and are unique. Otherwise, one cannot predict prices or welfare effects after a merger or a policy change. The conditions are related to the own- and cross-price effects, as well as the strength of the own and cross network effects. We show that most functional forms used in empirical work, such as logit type demand functions, tend to satisfy these conditions for realistic values of the respective parameters. Finally, using data on the Dutch daily newspaper industry, we estimate a flexible model of demand which satisfies the above conditions and evaluate the effects of a hypothetical merger and study the effects of a shrinking market for offline newspapers.},

I discuss the issues of which price the hypothetical monopolist should be thought of as raising, of whether we should look at profits changes on only one side or on both sides of the market and of which feedback among the two sides of the market we should take into account. I then derive the relevant formulas for Critical Loss Analysis. These look much uglier than in a single-sided market but in fact they are easy to calculate as they are still expressed in terms of elasticities and of current observed markups, prices and quantities. Data requirements are however higher as one needs to estimate the matrixes of the own and cross price elasticities of demand on the two-sides of the market and the matrixes of the network effects. The paper fills a gap in the economic literature, so much more as market definition in media markets is at the centre of many recent competition policy and regulation cases around the world.},

Second, it identifies four key sources of potential social biases in the payment card associations' determination of interchange fees: internalization by merchants of a fraction of cardholder surplus, issuers' per-transaction markup, merchant heterogeneity, and extent of cardholder multi-homing.

	abstract = {Monitored incomes from the sale of advertising space in print media have continuously declined since 2009, and despite a slight increase in 2013, the volume of sold advertising in newspapers and magazines significantly lags behind the advertising in the electronic media, especially in television. And it is despite the fact that several studies conducted on the effectiveness and efficiency of the so-called print advertising confirm that advertising in newspapers and magazines positively influences buying behavior of consumers. One of the causes of the low volume sales of advertising space in print media can be considered as decreasing marketability of newspapers and magazines and easier access to their online editions, which are for the reader in most cases free, respectively at low price compared to the annual pre-paid printed edition of the periodical. The paper analyzes the way of use of the advertising space in print media and its electronic editions on the market for mobile operators. It examines the attractiveness of advertising space in newspapers and magazines in comparison to their electronic version. The aim is to evaluate the impact of digitization on the use of advertising space in print media and evaluate the potential of advertising space in online editions of these media in terms of advertisers},

A media firm can either be financed by advertising revenue, by direct payment from the viewers (or the readers, if we consider newspapers), or by both. We show that the scope for raising revenues from consumer payment is constrained by other media firms offering close substitutes. This implies that the less differentiated the media firms’ content, the larger is the fraction of their revenue coming from advertising. A media firm’s scope for raising revenues from ads, on the other hand, is constrained by how many competitors it faces. We should thus expect that direct payment from the media consumers becomes more important the larger the number of competing media products.},

We find that two aspects of product differentiation have distinct effects: an absolute advantage in demand for the established firm makes entry harder, but a lower cross-price effect facilitates it. In the basic model we maintain the same quantity after entry. An extension of the model deals with the case where the threat of a predatory output increase after entry is made credible by carrying excess capacity prior to entry.},

We then show that the current practice of market definition in two-sided markets is only in part consistent with the above suggestions. Divergence between our suggestions and practice is due to the failure to fully incorporate the lessons from the economic theory of two-sided markets, to the desire to be consistent with previous practice and to the higher data requirements and the higher complexity of empirical analysis in cases involving two-sided platforms. In particular, competition authorities have failed to recognize the crucial difference between two-sided transaction and non-transaction markets and have been misled by the traditional argument that where there is no price, there is no market.},

We extend the concept of Upward Pricing Pressure ({UPP}) proposed by Farrell and Shapiro (2010) to two-sided markets. Examples of such markets are the newspaper market, where the demand for advertising is related to the number of readers, and the market for online search, where advertising demand depends on the number of users. The formulas we derive are useful for screening mergers among two-sided platforms. Due to the two-sidedness they depend on four sets of diversion ratios that can either be estimated using market-level demand data or elicited in surveys. In an application, we evaluate a hypothetical merger in the Dutch daily newspaper market. Our results indicate that it is important to take the two-sidedness of the market into account when evaluating {UPP}.{\textless}P{\textgreater}(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

As demand substitution is a crucial element for defining market, bad estimates of elasticities could blur the boundaries of relevant markets. Second, we propose a simple model that encompasses these features and in particular the two-sidedness of the market. Thirdly, we review some empirical papers that analyze the issue of demand estimation in printed media. Finally, we perform a statistical estimation on a dataset of magazines in order to provide a measure of the possible bias that could arise in the estimation of elasticities when one does not use a proper model.},
